# Heart Map SG

-	This is a crowd-sourced map where the public can share their stories. One feature component is the contribute form which includes a location field. It has ‘places autocomplete’ from google maps, once you start typing, places suggestions will display for the user to choose or the user may also just pick on the map for the location of their story. Once the form is submitted, the page will show the recently added story as a blue pin on the heartmap. Clicking on the pins will open a modal preview of the story. 
-	Data is not yet persistent, so it will be cleared if  the page is refreshed.
